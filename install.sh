# One channel per agent: plain copies beside an installed plugin are two
# listings of every skill in this pack, and the stale copies win. Refuse rather
# than create that, and refuse loudly — reproduced live 2026-08-29 on this very
# pack: a bare `npx @ssheleg/xr-dev` shipped all three skills as plain
# copies into the operator's ~/.claude/skills/ while the xr-dev plugin
# was enabled, because nothing here looked. installed_plugins.json is the
# record of what is installed and is read first; the marketplaces/ dir alone
# under-reports (a directory-sourced marketplace has no dir there, and plugin
# names differ from marketplace names), so it is kept only as the fallback
# signal. A missing or unparsable JSON reads as "no plugin" — fail open.
