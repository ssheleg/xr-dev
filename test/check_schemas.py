"""Resolve every `$schema` this repository declares, and validate against what it serves.

    python3 test/check_schemas.py

Deliberately NOT part of `npm test`. That suite is stdlib-only and offline by
design, so its `$schema` guard can only PIN addresses — it asserts that each
manifest names the one schema right for its document type, and refuses the dead
`claude-code-plugin.json` by name. Pinning is not proof: an address that resolved
when it was pinned can stop resolving, and a document that validated can drift out
of the schema it declares. This is the half that looks.

Both halves read `SCHEMA_FOR` from `test/validate.py`, so the address map has one
home. Two checks with two copies of a URL is how the copies disagree.

Exits 1 on the first thing it can prove wrong, and 2 when it cannot look at all —
a check that could not run must never read as one that ran and passed.
